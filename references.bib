  abstract={Stellar halo substructures were identified using statistical photometric parallax of blue main-sequence turnoff stars from 14 Sloan Digital Sky Survey stripes in the north Galactic cap. Four structures are consistent with previous measurements of the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream: the leading tail, the “bifurcated” stream, the trailing tail, and Stream C. The stellar overdensity in Virgo, about 15 kpc from the Sun, could arise from the crossing of the Parallel Stream and a new, candidate stream dubbed the Perpendicular Stream. The data suggests the presence of a wide stream near NGC 5466, with a distance of 5–15 kpc. Measurements of the flattening of the smooth stellar halo from the 14 stripes average q = 0.58, with a dispersion of 0.04.}

  abstract={Using multi-epoch observations of the Stripe 82 region from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure precise statistical proper motions of the stars in the Sagittarius (Sgr) stellar stream. The multi-band photometry and SDSS radial velocities allow us to efficiently select Sgr members and thus enhance the proper-motion precision to ~0.1 mas yr –1 . We measure separately the proper motion of a photometrically selected sample of the main-sequence turn-off stars, as well as spectroscopically selected Sgr giants. The data allow us to determine the proper motion separately for the two Sgr streams in the south found in Koposov et al. Together with the precise velocities from SDSS, our proper motions provide exquisite constraints of the three-dimensional motions of the stars in the Sgr streams.}

  abstract={We present a new N -body model for the tidal disruption of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the majority of angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints imposed by current wide-field surveys of its dynamically young ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 3 Gyr) tidal debris streams. In particular, this model resolves the conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years. While the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that this bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric component to the Galactic gravitational potential that can be described in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio ( c / a ) Φ = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio ( b / a ) Φ = 0.99 at radii 20 kpc < r < 60 kpc. The minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions ( l , b ) = (7°, 0°), (0°, 90°), and (97°, 0°) respectively, corresponding to a nearly oblate ellipsoid whose minor axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. This particular disk/halo orientation is difficult to reconcile within the general context of galactic dynamics (and cold dark matter models in particular), suggesting either that the orientation may have evolved significantly with time or that inclusion of other non-axisymmetric components (such as the gravitational influence of the Magellanic Clouds) in the model may obviate the need for triaxiality in the dark matter halo. The apparent proper motion of Sgr in this model is estimated to be (μ l cos b , μ b ) = (–2.16, 1.73) mas yr –1 , corresponding to a Galactocentric space velocity ( U , V , W ) = (230, –35, 195) km s –1 . Based on the velocity dispersion in the stellar tidal streams, we estimate that Sgr has a current bound mass M Sgr = 2.5 +1.3 –1.0 × 10 8 M ☉ . We demonstrate that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of Sgr, tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the metallicity distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams similar to those observed in recent studies. These models predict a strong evolution in the MDF of the model Sgr dwarf with time, indicating that the chemical abundances of stars in Sgr at the present day may be significantly different than the abundances of those already contributed to the Galactic stellar halo. We conclude by using the new N -body model to re-evaluate previous claims of the association of miscellaneous halo substructure with the Sgr dwarf.}

  abstract={We present three-dimensional space velocities of stars selected to be consistent with membership in the Virgo stellar substructure. Candidates were selected from SA 103, a single 40' × 40' field from our proper-motion (PM) survey in Kapteyn's Selected Areas (SAs), based on the PMs, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry, and follow-up spectroscopy of 215 stars. The signature of the Virgo substructure is clear in the SDSS color-magnitude diagram (CMD) centered on SA 103, and 16 stars are identified that have high Galactocentric-frame radial velocities ( V GSR > 50 km s –1 ) and lie near the CMD locus of Virgo. The implied distance to the Virgo substructure from the candidates is 14 ± 3 kpc. We derive mean kinematics from these 16 stars, finding a radial velocity V GSR = 153 ± 22 km s –1 and proper motions (μ α cos δ, μ δ ) = (– 5.24, –0.91) ± (0.43, 0.46) mas yr –1 . From the mean kinematics of these members, we determine that the Virgo progenitor was on an eccentric ( e ~ 0.8) orbit that recently passed near the Galactic center (pericentric distance R p ~ 6 kpc). This destructive orbit is consistent with the idea that the substructure(s) in Virgo originated in the tidal disruption of a Milky Way satellite. N -body simulations suggest that the entire cloud-like Virgo substructure (encompassing the "Virgo Overdensity" and the "Virgo Stellar Stream") is likely the tidal debris remnant from a recently disrupted massive (~10 9 M ☉ ) dwarf galaxy. The model also suggests that some other known stellar overdensities in the Milky Way halo (e.g., the Pisces Overdensity and debris near NGC 2419 and SEGUE 1) are explained by the disruption of the Virgo progenitor.}

  abstract={We show that in the anticenter region, between Galactic longitudes of 110° < l < 229°, there is an oscillating asymmetry in the main-sequence star counts on either side of the Galactic plane using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This asymmetry oscillates from more stars in the north at distances of about 2 kpc from the Sun to more stars in the south at 4–6 kpc from the Sun to more stars in the north at distances of 8–10 kpc from the Sun. We also see evidence that there are more stars in the south at distances of 12–16 kpc from the Sun. The three more distant asymmetries form roughly concentric rings around the Galactic center, opening in the direction of the Milky Way’s spiral arms. The northern ring, 9 kpc from the Sun, is easily identified with the previously discovered Monoceros Ring. Parts of the southern ring at 14 kpc from the Sun (which we call the TriAnd Ring) have previously been identified as related to the Monoceros Ring, and others have been called the Triangulum Andromeda Overdensity. The two nearer oscillations are approximated by a toy model in which the disk plane is offset by the order of 100 pc up and then down at different radii. We also show that the disk is not azimuthally symmetric around the Galactic anticenter and that there could be a correspondence between our observed oscillations and the spiral structure of the Galaxy. Our observations suggest that the TriAnd and Monoceros Rings (which extend to at least 25 kpc from the Galactic center) are primarily the result of disk oscillations.}

  abstract={M giants recovered from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey have recently been used to map the position and velocity distributions of tidal debris from the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy around the entire Galaxy. We compare this data set to both test-particle orbits and N -body simulations of satellite destruction run within a variety of rigid Milky Way potentials, and we find that the mass of the Milky Way within 50 kpc of its center should be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/619/2/807/img1.gif] {img1.gif} × 10 11 M ☉ in order for any Sgr orbit to simultaneously fit the velocity gradient in the Sgr trailing debris and the apocenter of the Sgr leading debris. Orbital pole precession of young debris and leading debris velocities in regions corresponding to older debris provide contradictory evidence in favor of oblate/prolate Galactic halo potentials, respectively, leading us to conclude that the orbit of Sgr has evolved over the past few gigayears. In light of this discrepancy, we consider constraints from only the younger portions of the debris within three models of the flattening of the Galactic potential [ q = 0.90 (O), 1.0 (S), and 1.25 (P), i.e., oblate, spherical, and prolate] in our further N -body simulations. On the basis of the velocity dispersion and width along the trailing tidal stream, we estimate the current bound mass of Sgr to be M Sgr = ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/619/2/807/img2.gif] {img2.gif} × 10 8 M ☉ independent of the form of the Galactic potential; this corresponds to a range of mass-to-light ratios ( M / L ) Sgr = 14-36( M / L ) ☉ for the Sgr core. Models with masses in this range best fit the apocenter of leading Sgr tidal debris when they orbit with a radial period of roughly 0.85 Gyr and have perigalactica and apogalactica of about 15 and 60 kpc, respectively. These distances scale with the assumed distance to the Sgr dwarf and the assumed depth of the Galactic potential. The density distribution of debris along the orbit in these models is consistent with the M giant observations, and debris at all orbital phases in which M giants are obviously present is younger (i.e., was lost more recently from the satellite) than the typical age of a Sgr M giant star.}

Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly visible in an RGB composite image created from three magnitude slices, and there is also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch.

The mean period of the type ab variables, 0.58 days, is also consistent. In addition, we have found two smaller overdensities in the halo, one of which may be related to the globular cluster Pal 5.}

We test whether the VOD can be attributed to a tilt in the stellar halo ellipsoid with respect to the plane of the Galactic disk and find that the observed symmetry of the north-south Galactic hemisphere star counts excludes this possibility. We argue that the Virgo Overdensity, in spite of its wide area and cloud-like appearance, is still best explained by a minor merger. Its appearance and position are qualitatively similar to a near perigalacticon merger event and, assuming that the VOD and the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) share the same progenitor, consistent with the VSS orbit determined by Casetti-Dinescu et al.}

  abstract={We study the number density distribution of a sample of K and M dwarf stars, matched north and south of the Galactic plane within a distance of 2 kpc from the Sun, using observations from the Ninth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We determine distances using the photometric parallax method, and in this context systematic effects exist which could potentially impact the determination of the number density profile with height from the Galactic plane—and ultimately affect a number density north-south asymmetry. They include: (1) the calibration of the various photometric parallax relations, (2) the ability to separate dwarfs from giants in our sample, (3) the role of stellar population differences such as age and metallicity, (4) the ability to determine the offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane, and (5) the correction for reddening from dust in the Galactic plane, though our stars are at high Galactic latitudes. We find the various analyzed systematic effects to have a negligible impact on our observed asymmetry, and using a new and larger sample of stars we confirm and refine the earlier discovery of Widrow et al. of a significant Galactic north-south asymmetry in the stellar number density distribution.}

Using 72 365 red-clump stars, we examine the mean velocity components in 3D between 6 < R < 10 kpc and −2 < Z < 2 kpc, concentrating on north–south differences. Simple parametric fits to the (R, Z) trends for Vϕ and the velocity dispersions are presented. We confirm the recently discovered gradient in mean Galactocentric radial velocity, VR, finding that the gradient is marked below the plane (δ〈VR〉/δR = −8 km s−1 kpc−1 for Z < 0, vanishing to zero above the plane), with a Z gradient thus also present. The vertical velocity, VZ, also shows clear, large-amplitude (|VZ| = 17 km s−1) structure, with indications of a rarefaction–compression pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. We perform a rigorous error analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and random errors. We confirm the north–south differences in VR and VZ along the line of sight, with the VR estimated independent of the proper motions. The complex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges for future modelling of the Galactic disc, with the Galactic bar, spiral arms and excitation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.},

The bulk velocity profile, which is derived from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration, shows a gradual trend across the Galactic midplane as well as smaller-scale features. We speculate that the North-South asymmetry, which has the appearance of a wavelike perturbation, is intrinsic to the disk. We explore the physics of this phenomenon through an analysis of the linearized Boltzmann and Poisson equations and through one-dimensional simulations. The perturbation may be excited by the passage of a satellite galaxy or dark matter subhalo through the Galactic disk, in which case we are witnessing a recent disk-heating event.}

In the region within 2 kpc outside the Sun's radius and ±2 kpc from the Galactic midplane, we show that stars above the plane exhibit net outward radial motions with downward vertical velocities, while stars below the plane have roughly the opposite behavior. We discuss this in the context of other recent findings, and conclude that we are likely seeing the signature of vertical disturbances to the disk due to an external perturbation.}
